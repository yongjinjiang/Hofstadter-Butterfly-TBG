# Hofstadter-Butterfly-TBG 
(ref: PhysRevB.88.125426(2013))
The superconductivity found in twisted bilayer graphene is the Physics World 2018 Breakthrough of the Year. In this project, we solve the Landau levels for the tight-binding model for monolayer and twisted Bilyer Graphene.

## Basic Usage:
#### 1. Use TBG_plot.ipynb file to Visualize the lattice structure. Choosing #Choose the geometrical parameters(m1,m2) for the Twisted Bilayer.  
#### 2. Use Twisted_Bilayer_butterfly_plot.py to obtain the Hofstadter-Butterfly.One can also change (m1,m2) etc to get the Hofstadter-Butterfly for different TGB lattices.
#### 3. Use ./mono-layer/monolayer_extended_model_butterfly.py to obtain Hofstadter-Butterfly for single-layer graphene.

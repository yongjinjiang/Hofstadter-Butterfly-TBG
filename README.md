# About
  - Hofstadter-Butterfly-TBG 
  - The superconductivity found in twisted bilayer graphene is the Physics World 2018 [Breakthrough](https://physicsworld.com/a/discovery-of-magic-angle-graphene-that-behaves-like-a-high-temperature-superconductor-is-physics-world-2018-breakthrough-of-the-year/) of the Year. 
  - In this project, we solve the Landau levels for the tight-binding model for monolayer and twisted Bilyer Graphene and reproduce the results of PhysRevB.88.125426(2013).

## Basic Usage:
#### 0. Install [kwant](https://kwant-project.org/) package before run any of the following:  
#### 1. Use TBG_plot.ipynb file to Visualize the lattice structure. Choose the geometrical parameters(m1,m2) for the Twisted Bilayer(ref: PhysRevB.88.125426(2013)).
#### 2. Use Twisted_Bilayer_butterfly_plot.py to obtain the Hofstadter-Butterfly.One can also change (m1,m2) etc to get the Hofstadter-Butterfly for different TGB lattices.
#### 3. Use ./mono-layer/monolayer_extended_model_butterfly.py to obtain Hofstadter-Butterfly for single-layer graphene.
